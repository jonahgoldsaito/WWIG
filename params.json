{"name":"WWIG","body":"## WWIG.\r\n### What Would I Get _(if i followed you)_\r\n\r\nMost of the stuff I want to see when I go to a Twitter timeline is drowned in a crap heap of things I _don't_ want to see.  \r\n\r\nOften the window is filled with @tweets that I wouldn't see anyway. \r\n\r\nI just want to quickly glance and see what I'd get (WWIG) if I followed you.  And why not a rough estimate of how many of those tweets I'd get per day.\r\n\r\nWWIG is just a simple bookmarklet that filters through the tweets on a Twitter timeline and fades out the ones that wouldn't cross your stream.  It also calculates some _very rudimentary_ estimates of the user's tweets/day from the twitter API.\r\n\r\nSimple.  Just something I wished Twitter did natively.\r\n\r\nSue me.\r\n\r\nActually don't.\r\n","tagline":"What Would I Get (if I followed you)","google":"UA-903173-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
